🌸 Grade Color Counter 🌸

The Grade Color Counter is a lightweight web tool designed to simplify the process of issuing color-coded cards based on student grade levels. This task is commonly done manually, which often leads to miscounts and lost time. I created this application to make the workflow more efficient, accurate, and pleasant to use.

The interface presents each grade as a large, colorful “flower” button. Every click increments the count for that grade. The counter keeps track of all values, allows undo and reset actions, displays real-time Chicago time, and automatically saves progress so nothing is lost on refresh. The output can also be edited and copied for reporting purposes.

A built-in “Manage Buttons” panel allows customization of the interface: existing buttons can be renamed or recolored, new grade buttons can be added, and unused ones can be removed. This flexibility ensures the counter adapts to different programs, classrooms, and event setups.

This tool removes the need for tally marks, mental tracking, and repeated recounts—making the card-issuing process more structured, consistent, and just a bit more fun.
